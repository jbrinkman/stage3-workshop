## Quick Start

### Run Evaluations
```bash
npx promptfoo eval --no-cache
```

> **Always use `--no-cache`** when running evaluations. This project uses external script files (`devin.js`, `claude.js`, etc.) and an external prompt file (`prompt-under-test.md`). Promptfoo's cache keys are based on the provider string and prompt text — they do not detect changes inside referenced files. Running without `--no-cache` can return stale results after you modify a script or the prompt file.

### View Results
Results are generated in `results.html` after each evaluation run.

## Configuration

### Active Provider
The configuration currently uses **Devin CLI** as the default provider for both generating responses and grading rubric evaluations.

### Available Providers
All scripts are cross-platform Node.js files that work on Windows, Linux, and Mac:

- **Claude Code CLI** (`claude.js`) - Anthropic's Claude Code assistant
- **Devin CLI** (`devin.js`) - Cognition's Devin AI assistant
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (`gh_copilot.js`) - GitHub's Copilot assistant
- **Google Antigravity CLI** (`agy.js`) - Google's Antigravity assistant
- **Kiro CLI** (`kiro.js`) - Amazon's Kiro AI assistant

To switch providers, edit `promptfooconfig.yaml` and uncomment the desired provider.

### How the Scripts Work

Each CLI script combines both provider and grader functionality in one file, auto-detecting the mode based on prompt format:

- **Provider mode**: When the prompt is plain text, the script acts as a provider and passes the text directly to the CLI tool
- **Grader mode**: When the prompt is a JSON array `[{role, content}, ...]`, the script acts as a grader, parsing the chat array and routing system/user messages appropriately

This eliminates the need for separate provider and grader scripts while maintaining full functionality.

## Evaluation Types

This demonstration includes three types of evaluations:

### 1. Deterministic Evaluations (contains/equiv)
Simple pass/fail checks based on content presence or exact matches.

**Example:**
```yaml
- vars:
    query: 'What is the difference between let and const in JavaScript?'
  assert:
    - type: contains
      value: 'let'
    - type: contains
      value: 'const'
    - type: contains
      value: 'reassign'
```

### 2. Rubric-Based Evaluations (`llm-rubric`)

Uses a judge LLM to score the response against natural language criteria. Each assertion evaluates a single, independent quality dimension, giving granular pass/fail per dimension in the web UI rather than one opaque score.

#### Grader Provider

The judge LLM is configured under `defaultTest.options.provider`. This project uses `devin.js` (which auto-detects grader mode), but the combined scripts for Claude, GitHub Copilot, Google Antigravity (AGY), and Kiro are also available.

> **How grader mode works**: When the combined scripts receive a JSON chat array
> (`[{"role":"system",...}, {"role":"user",...}]`), they automatically enter grader mode,
> parse the array, and route each part correctly to the CLI tool.
>
> Claude Code supports `--system-prompt` to replace its default context entirely,
> keeping system and user messages separate. Devin, GitHub Copilot, Google Antigravity (AGY), and Kiro don't have an
> equivalent flag, so their scripts concatenate the system instructions and user
> message into one combined prompt instead.

#### Assertion Parameters

Each `llm-rubric` assertion accepts these parameters:

| Parameter   | Type          | Required | Description |
|-------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| `value`     | string        | Yes      | The natural language criterion to evaluate. Write it as an observable statement: "The response includes a code example" not "the response is good". |
| `threshold` | float 0.0–1.0 | No       | Minimum score to pass this assertion. Defaults to `0.5` if omitted. |
| `metric`    | string        | No       | Label shown in the promptfoo web UI results table — useful for identifying which dimension failed. |
| `weight`    | number        | No       | Relative importance when computing the test's overall weighted score. `weight: 2` counts twice as much as `weight: 1`. Defaults to `1`. |

#### Example

```yaml
- vars:
    query: 'Explain the concept of recursion in programming'
  description: 'Recursion explanation - rubric with per-dimension scoring'
  assert:
    # Core definition — highest weight; must score at least 0.7
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: The response clearly defines what recursion is in plain language a non-expert could understand
      threshold: 0.7
      metric: clarity
      weight: 2

    # Code example — important for a technical explanation
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: The response includes at least one working code example that demonstrates recursion
      threshold: 0.7
      metric: code-example
      weight: 1.5

    # Base/recursive case — critical for correctness; strict threshold
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: The response explicitly explains both the base case (stopping condition) and the recursive case
      threshold: 0.8
      metric: base-case-explained
      weight: 2

    # Risks — nice to have; lower threshold and weight
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: The response mentions stack overflow or call stack depth as a potential pitfall
      threshold: 0.4
      metric: mentions-risks
      weight: 1
```

#### Design Guidance

- **Set `threshold` based on criticality.** Core requirements warrant `0.7`–`0.8`. Nice-to-have criteria can use `0.4`–`0.5`.
- **Use `weight` to express relative importance.** Don't just vary threshold — a critical dimension should also carry more weight so it influences the overall score proportionally.
- **One criterion per assertion.** Splitting dimensions into separate `llm-rubric` entries gives individual pass/fail per dimension in the web UI, rather than one opaque rubric score.
- **Write criteria as observable statements.** "The response includes at least one working code example" is better than "the response is well-explained".

### 3. Script-Based Evaluations

Custom deterministic evaluation logic written in JavaScript. Functions live in `eval-script.js` and are referenced directly from the config using `file://path:functionName` syntax.

**Example:**
```yaml
- vars:
    query: 'Write a function to validate an email address'
  description: 'Email validation - script-based eval'
  assert:
    - type: javascript
      value: file://eval-script.js:hasCodeFormatting
    - type: javascript
      value: file://eval-script.js:explainsWhy
    - type: javascript
      value: file://eval-script.js:mentionsBestPractices
```

**Functions in `eval-script.js`:**

| Function | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| `hasCodeFormatting(output)` | Response contains a fenced code block |
| `explainsWhy(output)` | Response includes reasoning words (because, since, therefore…) |
| `mentionsBestPractices(output)` | Response mentions best practices or common patterns |
| `isConcise(output)` | Response is under 2000 characters |

Each function returns `{ pass, score, reason }` so promptfoo can display a meaningful failure message.

**Adding your own functions:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  yourCustomCheck: (output) => {
    const pass = /* your logic */;
    return { pass, score: pass ? 1 : 0, reason: 'Explanation shown on failure' };
  }
};
```

For example, the `matchSchema-script.js` file contains a function that checks if the output matches a given JSON schema, and demonstrates how a custom function might be added. 

## Running Scripts Directly

You can test the CLI scripts directly to verify functionality:

```bash
# Provider mode (plain text prompt)
node ./devin.js "What is 2+2?" '{"config": {"model": "SWE-1.6"}}' "context"

# Grader mode (JSON array prompt)
node ./devin.js '[{"role":"system","content":"You are an evaluator..."},{"role":"user","content":"Test message"}]' '{}'
```

## Prompt Under Test

The `prompt-under-test.md` file contains the actual prompt being evaluated. Using an external file provides:

- Version control for prompt changes
- Easy editing without modifying configuration
- Reusability across different test configurations
- Clear separation between test logic and prompt content

## EDD Workflow

1. **Define Success Criteria** - Determine what makes a prompt "good" for your use case
2. **Create Evaluation Tests** - Set up deterministic, rubric, and script-based tests
3. **Write Initial Prompt** - Create your prompt in the external file
4. **Run Evaluations** - Test against your criteria
5. **Iterate** - Refine prompt based on evaluation results
6. **Regression Test** - Ensure changes don't break existing successful tests

## Test Cases

The current configuration includes 6 test cases:

1. **JavaScript concepts** (deterministic) - Tests let vs const explanation
2. **Python string reversal** (deterministic) - Tests Python coding knowledge
3. **Recursion explanation** (rubric) - Evaluates completeness of recursion explanation
4. **Error handling best practices** (rubric) - Assesses JavaScript error handling knowledge
5. **Email validation function** (script-based) - Tests code generation quality
6. **Equality operators** (script-based) - Tests explanation quality with custom assertions

## Customization

### For Your Own Use Case

1. Replace `prompt-under-test.md` with your own prompt
2. Modify test cases in `promptfooconfig.yaml` to match your domain
3. Add custom evaluation functions to `eval-script.js` as needed
4. Adjust rubric criteria to reflect your quality standards
5. Switch to your preferred AI provider in the configuration

### Adding New Evaluation Functions

Edit `eval-script.js` to add custom functions:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  yourCustomFunction: (output) => {
    // Your evaluation logic
    return {
      pass: true/false,
      score: 0-1,
      reason: 'Explanation of result'
    };
  }
};
```

## Requirements

- Node.js (for promptfoo and CLI scripts)
- CLI tools for the providers you want to use:
  - Claude Code CLI (`claude`)
  - Devin CLI (`devin`)
  - GitHub Copilot CLI (`gh copilot`)
  - Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`)
  - Kiro CLI (`kiro-cli`)
  - _or_ a local Ollama instance (`ollama`)

## Troubleshooting

### Provider CLI Installation
Ensure your chosen CLI tool is properly installed and accessible in your PATH.

### Script Execution Issues
If you encounter issues running the Node.js scripts:
- Verify Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Check script permissions: `ls -la *.js` (should be executable)
- Test scripts directly using the examples in "Running Scripts Directly" section

### Configuration Errors
If promptfoo reports configuration errors:
- Verify YAML syntax in `promptfooconfig.yaml`
- Check that the referenced script files exist
- Ensure model names match what your CLI tool supports
- For Ollama, ensure the local instance is running and accessible, and that you've set the correct model name and port in the configuration
